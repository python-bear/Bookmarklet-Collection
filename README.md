3. Click on the three lines/dots button to the far right of the search bar. Move to step four.
4. If there is a `Bookmarks` menu cascade move to step five, otherwise move  to step six.
5. Click on the `Bookmarks` cascade menu and find the `Import Bookmarks And Settings...` button, if you find it go to step seven, otherwise go to step eight.
6. Open your browser's settings page and search for `Bookmarks` then if you find the `Import Bookmarks And Settings...` button go to step seven, otherwise go to step eight.
7. In the sources drop-down box select `Bookmarks HTML File` and tick the `Favourites/Bookmarks` checkbox if it exists. Move to step nine.

Click on the three dots/lines button for the bookmarks manager, it should be in the top right-hand corner then click on `Import Bookmarks`, or similar then move to step nine if it opens a file explorer or step seven if it takes you to one of your browser's settings pages and displays a popup box.
11. If your bookmarks bar has a new folder named `Imported` go to step twelve, if nothing has changed then you have made a mistake or your browser doesn't support importing this file as a bookmark, or if you have a new folder named `Bookmarklets` in your bookmarks bar then go to step thirteen.
12. Navigate through the `Imported` bookmarks folder to the `Bookmarklets` folder, then drag the `Bookmarklets` folder to your bookmarks bar (or wherever you want it to be). Delete the now bookmarkless `Imported` bookmarks folder and move to step thirteen.
