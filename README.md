# SICK SET OF BOOKMARKLETS (SSoB) #

## What Is This? ##

A collection of a few bookmarklets from a range of sources, such as old forums, websites from the WayBack machine, bookmarklet tutorial websites and a few custom ones. 
  
## Setup Instructions ##

Navigate through the following steps, following them as applicable:

1. Download the `bookmarklet_bookmarks.html` file from this GitHub repository (Sick-Set-Of-Bookmarklets), then move to step two.
2. Open your chrome-based browser (others may work but haven't been tested). Move to step three.
3. Click on the three lines/dots button to the far right of the search bar. Move to step four.
4. If there is a `Bookmarks` menu cascade move to step five, otherwise move  to step six.
5. Click on the `Bookmarks` cascade menu and find the `Import Bookmarks And Settings...` button, if you find it go to step seven, otherwise go to step eight.
6. Open your browser's settings page and search for `Bookmarks` then if you find the `Import Bookmarks And Settings...` button go to step seven, otherwise go to step eight.
7. In the sources drop-down box select `Bookmarks HTML File` and tick the `Favourites/Bookmarks` checkbox if it exists. Move to step nine.
8. Find your browser's `Bookmarks Manager`, you can find it in the settings or right click on your bookmarks bar and then choosing the `Bookmarks Manager` button. Move to step ten.
9. Click the `Choose File` button if applicable and then navigate through the file explorer to where you saved/downloaded the `bookmarklet_bookmarks.html` file to choose it and then go to step eleven.
10. Click on the three dots/lines button for the bookmarks manager, it should be in the top right-hand corner then click on `Import Bookmarks`, or similar then move to step nine if it opens a file explorer or step seven if it takes you to one of your browser's settings pages and displays a popup box.
11. If your bookmarks bar has a new folder named `Imported` go to step twelve, if nothing has changed then you have made a mistake or your browser doesn't support importing this file as a bookmark, or if you have a new folder named `Bookmarklets` in your bookmarks bar then go to step thirteen.
12. Navigate through the `Imported` bookmarks folder to the `Bookmarklets` folder, then drag the `Bookmarklets` folder to your bookmarks bar (or wherever you want it to be). Delete the now bookmark-less `Imported` bookmarks folder and move to step thirteen.
13. You're done, if your followed this properly you should now be able to use the bookmarklets that you downloaded.

## How To Use These Bookmarklets ##

Bookmarklets are bookmarks, but instead of containing a URL that your browser moves you to they instead specify that they contain JavaScript code that is to be executed on/on behalf of the current website you are in. All you need to be able to do as a user of a bookmarklet is be able to move your mouse over to their location on your bookmarks bar and click on them. If you want to edit them (change their name, or their code) is find them in your bookmarks bar or bookmarks manager, right click on them, and then choose the edit button. 

If you are looking to code your own bookmarklets and you already understand web development you can use the [Bookmarklet Devkit](https://www.taosdev.com/bookmarklet-devkit/) to convert your JavaScript code into a one line version easily. 

Below is a list of the bookmarklets included in the `bookmarklet_bookmarks.html` file and an explanation of what they do. If you don't want all of the bookmarklets in the `bookmarklet_bookmarks.html` file then you can just drag the ones in the list below that you do want to your bookmarks bar, and they should work just fine.

### Bookmarklet Documentation ###

Reloading your page will remove/end the effect of all (if any) bookmarklet that you have used on it.
